== Where to Start?

Depending on your goals and interests, you can choose different paths through the Starknet Book. Here are some recommendations based on various objectives:

* If you're a *complete beginner* and want to start learning about Cairo and Starknet from scratch, follow the book in its entirety, starting with *Chapter 1: Getting Started*.

* If you're an *experienced developer* looking to quickly dive into writing scalable and decentralized smart contracts, focus on *Chapters 1 and 2*.

* If you're a *frontend developer* wanting to integrate Starknet with a React frontend, prioritize *Chapter 5: Frontend* after covering the basics in *Chapters 1 and 2*.

* If you're a *DevOps engineer* or *node operator* interested in running a Starknet node and indexer, head straight to *Chapter 6: Running a Node*.

* If you're a *security researcher* or *smart contract auditor* wanting to learn about the Account Abstraction feature and its implications, go for *Chapter 7: Account Abstraction*.

* If you're a *blockchain enthusiast* curious about the underlying architecture and mechanics of Starknet and Cairo, explore *Chapters 8 and 9*.

* If you're a *cryptography expert* or *researcher* eager to understand the fundamentals of STARKs and their connection to the Starknet ecosystem, delve into *Chapter 10: STARKs*.

Feel free to mix and match these paths based on your unique interests and requirements.
